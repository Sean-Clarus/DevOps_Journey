Absolute path vs Relative path

Even in the same directory, we need to type ./xyz-script to open the file

File Permissions:
    rwxr-xr-x
    root-group-all others

To change permissions:
    chmod a+x script-name (also numbers can be used)

The permission number can consist of three or four digits, ranging from 0 to 7.

When 3 digits number is used, the first digit represents the permissions of the file’s owner,
the second one the file’s group and the last one all other users.

The write, read, and execute permissions have the following number value:

r (read) = 4
w (write) = 2
x (execute) = 1
no permissions = 0

Each digit of the permissions number may be a sum of 4, 2, 1 and 0:

0 (0+0+0) – No permission.
1 (0+0+1) – Only execute permission.
2 (0+2+0) – Only write permission.
3 (0+2+1) – Write and execute permissions.
4 (4+0+0) – Only read permission.
5 (4+0+1) – Read and execute permission.
6 (4+2+0) – Read and write permissions.
7 (4+2+1) – Read, write, and execute permission.

For example, if the permission number is set to 750 it means that the file’s owner has read, write and execute permission, file’s group has read and execute permissions, and other users have no permissions:

Owner: rwx=4+2+1=7
Group: r-x=4+0+1=5
Others: r-x=0+0+0=0

File ownership can be changed using the chown command and permissions with the chmod command.
